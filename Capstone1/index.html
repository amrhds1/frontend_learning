            <li> <h3> Research Data Scientist - Meta Platforms (Facebook)</h3>
                Jan 2022 - Present
                <ul>
                    <p> </p>
                    <li> Data science lead in the anti-scraping team, leading
                        MLE and DS to build ML systems that label, detect and
                        action on 20M+ scraping sessions daily at scale </li>
                    <li> Initiated and drove partnerships across five teams to
                        jointly mitigate
                        unauthorized access to user data, surpassing org’s
                        multiple topline goals:
                        <ul>
                            <li> Developed ML classifiers that detect 15M+
                                scraping sessions daily with
                                95% precision, boosting detection volume by 10x
                                and exceeding annual
                                stretch goal for detection recall. </li>
                            <li> Created new rules that label 25M+ scraping
                                sessions daily with 90%+
                                human review precision, surpassing annual
                                stretch goal for label recall by
                                20% only within a month </li>
                            <li> Modified model architecture of the contextual
                                multi-armed bandit system
                                that selects optimal responses to scrapers,
                                reducing normalized MSEs of
                                ridge regression models by 40%+ and preventing
                                out-of-memory issue. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li> Prevented 300K benign DAUs from experiencing user
                            friction daily (20% of
                            org false positive budget and 50% of existing FPs)
                            without compromising true
                            positives, by proposing an alternative way of how ML
                            classifiers should use
                            input labels for model training and leading the
                            migration effort. </li>
                        <li> Freed up the org’s user appeal budget by 30% by
                            applying topic modeling
                            (LDA) to more accurately attribute appeal reports to
                            the org’s intervention
                            system. Defined the success metrics and project
                            roadmap, mentored MLEs for
                            successful implementation, and established
                            partnership with Appeal Ops team
                            to validate the accuracy of the new attribution
                            logic. </li>

                        accuracy by building
                        loss mitigation strategies from scratch based on
